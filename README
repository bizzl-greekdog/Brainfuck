A very simple brainfuck interpreter.
The binary takes exactly one argument, which is the location of the brainfuck program (e.g. examples/cat.bf).
All IO is done via stdin and stdout.

This interpreter is technically able to use an infinite number of memory cells, but you probably shouldn't try it out ;)
